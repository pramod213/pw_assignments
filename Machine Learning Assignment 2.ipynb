    "\n",
    "We might identify several features or parameters that impact the final prediction when you build a model. Feature selection—or pruning—identifies the most important features within the training set and eliminates irrelevant ones. For example, to predict if an image is an animal or human, you can look at various input parameters like face shape, ear position, body structure, etc. You may prioritize face shape and ignore the shape of the eyes.\n",

    "Regularization: \n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a collection of training/optimization techniques that seek to reduce overfitting. These methods try to eliminate those factors that do not impact the prediction outcomes by grading features based on importance. For example, mathematical calculations apply a penalty value to features with minimal impact. Consider a statistical model attempting to predict the housing prices of a city in 20 years. Regularization would give a lower penalty value to features like population growth and average annual income but a higher penalty value to the average annual temperature of the city.\n",

    "Ensembling combines predictions from several separate machine learning algorithms. Some models are called weak learners because their results are often inaccurate.

The two main ensemble methods are bagging and boosting. Boosting trains different machine learning models one after another to get the final result, while bagging trains them in parallel.\n",

    "Data augmentation is a machine learning technique that changes the sample data slightly every time the model processes it. You can do this by changing the input data in small ways. When done in moderation, data augmentation makes the training sets appear unique to the model and prevents the model from learning their characteristics. For example, applying transformations such as translation, flipping, and rotation to input images."

    "Some common methods for detecting overfitting are:\n",
    "    1. Split the data\n",
    " \n",
    "One of the simplest and most effective methods to detect overfitting and underfitting is to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and test. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune the model parameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the model performance on new data. By comparing the model performance on different sets, you can identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting. For example, if the model has a high accuracy on the training set but a low accuracy on the validation or test set, it is likely overfitting. If the model has a low accuracy on both the training and validation or test set, it is likely underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method to detect overfitting and underfitting is to use cross-validation, which is a technique that splits the data into multiple folds and uses each fold as a validation set while training the model on the rest of the folds. Cross-validation can help reduce the variance and bias of the model estimates and provide a more reliable measure of the model performance. By averaging the cross-validation scores, you can assess how well the model generalizes to new data. A low cross-validation score indicates underfitting, while a high variance between the cross-validation scores indicates overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Plot learning curves\n",
    "\n",
    "A third method to detect overfitting and underfitting is to plot learning curves, which are graphs that show how the model performance changes as a function of the training set size or the number of iterations. Learning curves can help you visualize how the model learns from the data and whether it suffers from high bias or high variance. A typical learning curve has two lines: one for the training score and one for the validation score. If the two lines are close and low, it means the model is underfitting. If the two lines are far apart and high, it means the model is overfitting. If the two lines converge and plateau, it means the model is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "A fourth method to prevent overfitting and underfitting is to apply regularization, which is a technique that adds a penalty term to the model loss function to reduce the complexity or flexibility of the model. Regularization can help avoid overfitting by preventing the model from learning noise or irrelevant features from the data. It can also help avoid underfitting by encouraging the model to learn more from the data. There are different types of regularization, such as L1, L2, or dropout, that have different effects on the model weights or activations. By choosing the appropriate regularization method and parameter, you can improve the model performance and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfit models experience high bias—they give inaccurate results for both the training data and test set. On the other hand, overfit models experience high variance—they give accurate results for the training set but not for the test set. More model training results in less bias but variance can increase."

    "Variance is the measure of spread in data from its mean position. In machine learning , variance is the variability of the model that how much it is sensitive to another subset of the training dataset. i.e. how much it can adjust on the new subset of the training dataset.\n",

    "    Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of models. In essence, regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging the model from learning overly complex patterns that may not generalize well to unseen data. This helps create simpler, more robust models.\n",

    "Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging the model from assigning too much importance to any one feature.\n",
    "\n",
    " Some Common Regularization Techniques are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 and L2 Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization adds the absolute values of the weights to the loss function. This encourages some weights to become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. It’s a handy tool when you suspect that only a subset of your features is essential.\n",
    "L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds the square of the weights to the loss function. This tends to evenly distribute the importance across all features, reducing the magnitude of weights and preventing them from growing too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dropout\n",
    "Dropout is a popular regularization technique specifically designed for neural networks. During training, dropout randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons in each layer. This simulates training multiple neural networks in parallel, forcing the model to be more robust and preventing it from relying too heavily on any one neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a team of experts. In each meeting (epoch), a random subset of experts doesn’t show up. This forces the team to become more self-reliant and adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Early Stopping\n",
    "Early stopping is a straightforward yet effective technique. Instead of training your model for a fixed number of epochs, you monitor its performance on a validation set. When performance stops improving or starts degrading, you stop training.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like cooking pasta; you don’t set a timer for exactly 10 minutes regardless of how the pasta is cooking. You taste it along the way to ensure it’s just right. Similarly, early stopping ensures your model doesn’t “overcook” on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Augmentation\n",
    "Data augmentation is a regularization technique, particularly popular in computer vision. It involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to your existing data, like rotating, cropping, or flipping images."
